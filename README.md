# Quora-Question-Similarity
  Welcome to the repository. This is my solution to the Kaggle Challenge https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-question-pairs.

### Dataset
  The dataset for the problem is available on the Kaggle Challenge page.

### Model
  Two different versions of Siamese LSTM Model was implemented. First one using pretrained embedding, and the second one without pretrained embeddings.
  Using pretrained embeddings gives better result but much more time to train when compared to the model without pretrained embeddings
